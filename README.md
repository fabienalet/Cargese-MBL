# Tutorials

There are 5 notebooks on the following topics (in order of complexity):

- Basic illustration of the Lanczos algorithm
- Static properties of the XXZ random field chain
- Dynamical properties of the XXZ random field chain
- Floquet Quantum circuits and time crystals
- Scars in the PXP and related models

These tutorials and the associated python codes have been written by Nicolas Mac√©, some time ago. Many thanks to him. Please drop him an email [  n [dot] mace [at] protonmail [dot] com ] if you like them and definitively contact him if you use the Python libraries in ```lib``` for your research!

See ```Setup.md``` for the setup for the Python Notebooks

# C++ codes

There are also three (perhaps four) C++ codes that you should be able to use to perform large scale simulations of MBL problems (all for the random-field XXZ spin chain model, but pretty easy to adapt)

- Shift-invert code to get interior eigenpairs
- Krylov time evolution code
- Basic TEBD code
- (not written yet) MPO Lindblad code
